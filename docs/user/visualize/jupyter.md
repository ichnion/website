Visualization empowers you to inspect your digital footprints including potential values and possible risks. And it enables you to understand what data is collected about us.

## How to use Jupyter Notebook with Ichnion ? 

If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebook, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/), or look at [the other visualization](https://ichnion.github.io/website/docs/user/visualize/other).

Otherwise, [download the Jupyter example](https://github.com/ichnion/jupyter-examples) we made and follow the same steps as in the google-location-history.ipynb file to visualize your data.
