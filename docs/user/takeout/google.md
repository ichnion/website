title: Google Takeout
---

Google allows you to request the data you have on Google accounts and services and export it through [Google Takeout website](https://takeout.google.com/).  

You select various sorts of data, then ask for it to be delivered in `.zip` file format or `.tgz` format.  Google then processes and prepares the data in the background, and after a while you receive an email with a link to the archive when it is ready to download.

- Click on the download link on your computer, and get a `.zip` (or `.tgz`) archive file stored locally.
- Double click on the `.zip` file to unwrap the files onto your computer's file system.
- Explore the files on your computer.

From this point you can use the Ichnion Excavator to extract personal information from your data archive.
