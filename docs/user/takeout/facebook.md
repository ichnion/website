Facebook allows you to request the data you have on your Facebook account and export it.

To request log into your facebook account and do the following

- Click on the arrow next to the notification bell
- Choose Settings & Privacy, then settings
- On the left side click Your Facebook information.
- In the "download your information column" click view.

From this point you can select which data from which date range you would like to download. You select various sorts of data, then ask for it to be delivered in `.html` file format or `.json` format. Facebppl then processes and prepares the data in the background, and after a while you can download them from your account.
