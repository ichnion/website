To help you get a hold of your personal data, we developed a tool called Excavator. Excavator extracts, stores and visualizes your personal data exports.

In this part, you will learn how to safely collect and analyze your own data locally.

### Prerequisite

Currently, we support *part of* `Google Takeout` and `Facebook` data. You need to prepare the applicable data from [Google Takeout](takeout/google.md) or [Facebook](takeout/facebook.md). Supported files are for example.

- Google Takout
  - `MyActivity.json`
  - `search-history.json`
  - `watch-history.json`
  - `Location History.json`
  - `Saved Place.json`
  - `Semantic Location History.json`
  - `All the .json files from Google Fit "All Sessions".`

- Facebook
  - `device_location.json`
  - `primary_location.json`
  - `primary_public_location.json`
  - `last_location.json`
  - `location_history.json`

See the full and up-to-date list on each takeout page.
