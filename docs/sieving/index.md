We recently developed a tool that hide sensitive data from your big companies files. It is really useful if you want to share your files without spreading precious data, but also if you store for a long time your files, and want to prevent yourself from any leak.

### What sensitive data are currently managed by `sieving`?

It is really easy for developers to contribute to sieving and particularly to add new sensitive data managed by the scanner. So if you have any idea of what data could/should be hidden, please feel free to contribute. Currently, `sieving` manages:

- `Email addresses`
- `IP addresses`
- `IBAN`
- `Japanese Phone Numbers`
